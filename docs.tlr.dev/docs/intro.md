# The open-source universal secret manager for developers

Never leave your terminal to use secrets while developing, testing, and building your apps.

Instead of custom scripts, tokens in your `.zshrc` files, visible `EXPORT`s in your bash history, misplaced `.env.production` files and more around your workstation -- just use `teller` and connect it to any vault, key store, or cloud service you like (Teller support Hashicorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, and many more).

You can use Teller to tidy your own environment or for your team as a process and best practice.

# Tutorial Intro
